Want to know what the Visualizer is and how it works? Now you can read about it in the [What is XState?](/docs/visualizer/) section.

Weâ€™ll keep the introductory documentation updated, and add introductions to further Stately products in the future.

If you have any feedback about the Visualizer introduction, or anything else that should be added to the documentation, please let us know in the [Stately Discord](https://discord.gg/xstate).
