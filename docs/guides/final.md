# Final states

In statecharts, you can declare a state as a **final state**. The final state indicates that its parent state is “done”. To learn more, read the [final state section in our introduction to statecharts](./introduction-to-state-machines-and-statecharts/index.md#final-state).

## API

To indicate that a state node is final, set its `type` property to `'final'`:

```js
const lightMachine = createMachine({
  id: 'light',
  initial: 'green',
  states: {
    green: {
      on: {
        TIMER: { target: 'yellow' }
      }
    },
    yellow: {
      on: {
        TIMER: { target: 'red' }
      }
    },
    red: {
      type: 'parallel',
      states: {
        crosswalkNorth: {
          initial: 'walk',
          states: {
            walk: {
              on: {
                PED_WAIT: { target: 'wait' }
              }
            },
            wait: {
              on: {
                PED_STOP: { target: 'stop' }
              }
            },
            stop: {
              // 'stop' is a final state node for 'crosswalkNorth'
              type: 'final'
            }
          },
          onDone: {
            actions: 'stopCrosswalkNorth'
          }
        },
        crosswalkEast: {
          initial: 'walk',
          states: {
            walk: {
              on: {
                PED_WAIT: { target: 'wait' }
              }
            },
            wait: {
              on: {
                PED_STOP: { target: 'stop' }
              }
            },
            stop: {
              // 'stop' is a final state node for 'crosswalkEast'
              type: 'final'
            }
          },
          onDone: {
            actions: 'stopCrosswalkEast'
          }
        }
      },
      onDone: 'green'
    }
  }
});
```

In a compound state, reaching a final child state node (with `{ type: 'final' }`) will internally raise a `done(...)` event for that compound state node (e.g., `"done.state.light.crosswalkEast"`). Using `onDone` is equivalent to defining a transition for this event.

## Parallel states

When every child state node in a parallel state node is _done_, the parent parallel state node is also _done_. When every final state node in every child compound node is reached, the `done(...)` event will be raised for the parallel state node.

This is very useful in modeling parallel tasks. For example, below there is a shopping machine where `user` and `items` represent two parallel tasks of the `cart` state:

```js
const shoppingMachine = createMachine({
  id: 'shopping',
  initial: 'cart',
  states: {
    cart: {
      type: 'parallel',
      states: {
        user: {
          initial: 'pending',
          states: {
            pending: {
              entry: 'getUser',
              on: {
                RESOLVE_USER: { target: 'success' },
                REJECT_USER: { target: 'failure' }
              }
            },
            success: { type: 'final' },
            failure: {}
          }
        },
        items: {
          initial: 'pending',
          states: {
            pending: {
              entry: 'getItems',
              on: {
                RESOLVE_ITEMS: { target: 'success' },
                REJECT_ITEMS: { target: 'failure' }
              }
            },
            success: { type: 'final' },
            failure: {}
          }
        }
      },
      onDone: 'confirm'
    },
    confirm: {
      // ...
    }
  }
});
```

The `onDone` transition will only take place when all of the child states of `'cart'` (e.g., `'user'` and `'items'`) are in their final states. In the case of the shopping machine, once the `'shopping.cart.user.success'` and `'shopping.cart.items.success'` state nodes are reached, the machine will transition from the `'cart'` to the `'confirm'` state.

::: warning

The `onDone` transition cannot be defined on the root node of the machine. This is because `onDone` is a transition on a `'done.state.*'` event, and when a machine reaches its final state, it can no longer accept any events.

:::

## Notes

- A final state node only indicates that its immediate parent is _done_. It does not affect the _done_ status of any higher parents, except with parallel state nodes which are _done_ when all of its child compound state nodes are _done_.
- A parallel state that reaches a final substate does not stop receiving events until all its siblings are done. The final substate can still be exited with an event.
- Final state nodes cannot have any children. They are atomic state nodes.
- You can specify `entry` and `exit` actions on final state nodes.
