Workaround based on [this comment](https://github.com/vuejs/vuepress/issues/1802#issuecomment-533890727)
Implementation contained in this `.vuepress/theme` directory [details](https://github.com/rundeck/docs/commit/1e0f1cd066ee4dc1007c34a41b86929443f00fba)

To remove this workaround, simply remove `docs/.vuepress/theme` directory
