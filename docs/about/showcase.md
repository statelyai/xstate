# Showcase

There are many developers and teams using XState [in the wild](https://github.com/statelyai/xstate/issues/255), to help control various aspects of their applications, in the frontend and backend, and in many different frameworks (or even without a framework!):

- [Nhost](https://nhost.io) uses XState to manage the authentication state and transitions of their [Vanilla, React and Vue libraries](https://github.com/nhost/nhost). Nhost is an Open Source Firebase Alternative with GraphQL.
- [Amazon's Amplify UI](https://docs.amplify.aws/ui/) uses XState for its Authenticator component ([see here](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-ui/blob/main/packages/ui/src/machines/authenticator/index.ts))
- The [Hashicorp Vault project](https://vaultproject.io) uses XState to control contextual user flows for getting new users up and running. The machines are [in the open-source repository](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault).
- The [Service Workies game](https://serviceworkies.com/) has many levels whose flows are controlled by XState.

- "At [bridge21.com](https://bridge21.com) we are re-writing our site using XState 3 and react-automata. It's a game changer.
- [KongHQ](https://konghq.com/products/kong-manager) has it "...deployed to production in Kong to handle form states (error, loading, modal, fetch machines etc.) [in our Vue app](https://konghq.com/products/kong-manager)"
- "Using XState 4 extensively in [4D Healthware](https://www.4dhealthware.com/)'s frontend app.
- "We are using XState at [Meru Health](https://www.meruhealth.com/) in our React Native app for managing many interactions.
  - There is also a relevant [presentation of using XState at React Helsinki](https://www.facebook.com/fraktio/videos/780228525664779/?t=4263)
- "I used XState in a touchable app for the Royal Tyrrell Museum (Alberta - Canada) and documented its use in this article: ["Modeling a Screensaver with a Statechart, a real use case"](https://medium.com/@carloslfu/modeling-a-screensaver-with-a-statechart-a-real-use-case-f57301682570)."
- "Used XState for the navigation of a keg analytics web-app [BinaryBeer](https://binarybeer.io/)."
- "Used XState to model data fetching and filtering of a collection of products ðŸ‘‰ [stimm.com](https://stimm.com)"
- "We're now using xstate to power a couple of the more complicated interactions at my place in our Behavior Insights Engine at [Maritz](https://www.maritz.com/).
- At [Cypress](https://cypress.io) we chose XState to manage state for our open source [Real World App](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-realworld-app). The app is a payment application used to demonstrate real-world usage of Cypress testing methods, patterns, and workflows. [The machines](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-realworld-app/tree/develop/src/machines) are used for several different types of scenarios present in modern, responsive web applications.
- "We use XState at the backend in projects to control entity state" (https://www.linkedin.com/in/haltentech-team)
- "I used XState to create an (open source) version of the classic Tower of Hanoi puzzle game. Two state machines are used, one for screen interaction logic and the other for game interaction logic. Also includes automated test generation with model based testing tools." [Tower of Hanoi app](https://towerofhanoi.app)
- "XState completely changed how I think about programming complex logic for fullstack applications - all core logic for streaming summaries on [YouTube Summarized](https://www.youtubesummarized.com) is now encapsulated in XState machines both on the frontend and backend. The visual editor makes it easy to spot edge cases and error states that should be handled, resulting in a very robust and stable system."
