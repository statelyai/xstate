Call `getPersistedSnapshot()` to get serializable actor state.

```ts
const persisted = actor.getPersistedSnapshot();
localStorage.setItem('checkout', JSON.stringify(persisted));
```

Restore the actor with the `snapshot` option.

```ts
const restored = createActor(machine, {
  snapshot: JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('checkout')!)
}).start();
```

Persisted snapshots may include child actor state. Keep the actor logic compatible with snapshots already stored by your application.

## Persistence cheatsheet

```ts
const persisted = actor.getPersistedSnapshot();
const restored = createActor(logic, { snapshot: persisted }).start();
```
