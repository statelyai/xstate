# @xstate/test

## 1.0.0-alpha.1

### Patch Changes

- [#3864](https://github.com/statelyai/xstate/pull/3864) [`59f3a8e`](https://github.com/statelyai/xstate/commit/59f3a8e) Thanks [@davidkpiano](https://github.com/davidkpiano)! - Event cases are now specified as an array of event objects, instead of an object with event types as keys and event object payloads as values:

  ```diff
  const shortestPaths = getShortestPaths(someMachine, {
  - eventCases: {
  -   click: [{ x: 10, y: 10 }, { x: 20, y: 20 }]
  - }
  + events: [
  +   { type: 'click', x: 10, y: 10 },
  +   { type: 'click', x: 20, y: 20 }
  + ]
  });
  ```

## 1.0.0-alpha.0

### Major Changes

- [#3036](https://github.com/statelyai/xstate/pull/3036) Thanks [@mattpocock](https://github.com/mattpocock), [@davidkpiano](https://github.com/davidkpiano)! - Substantially simplified how paths and plans work in `TestModel`. Changed `getShortestPlans` and `getSimplePlans` to `getShortestPaths` and `getSimplePaths`. These functions now return an array of paths, instead of an array of plans which contain paths.

  Also added `getPaths`, which defaults to `getShortestPaths`. This can be passed a `pathGenerator` to customize how paths are generated.

- [#3036](https://github.com/statelyai/xstate/pull/3036) Thanks [@mattpocock](https://github.com/mattpocock)! - Moved event cases out of `events`, and into their own attribute called `eventCases`:

  ```ts
  const model = createTestModel(machine, {
    eventCases: {
      CHOOSE_CURRENCY: [
        {
          currency: 'GBP'
        },
        {
          currency: 'USD'
        }
      ]
    }
  });

  model.getPaths().forEach((path) => {
    it(path.description, async () => {
      await path.test({
        events: {
          CHOOSE_CURRENCY: ({ event }) => {
            console.log(event.currency);
          }
        }
      });
    });
  });
  ```

  `eventCases` will also now always produce a new path, instead of only creating a path for the first case which matches.

- [#3036](https://github.com/statelyai/xstate/pull/3036) Thanks [@davidkpiano](https://github.com/davidkpiano)! - Removed `.testCoverage()`, and instead made `getPlans`, `getShortestPlans` and `getSimplePlans` cover all states and transitions enabled by event cases by default.

- [#3036](https://github.com/statelyai/xstate/pull/3036) Thanks [@davidkpiano](https://github.com/davidkpiano)! - Added validation on `createTestModel` to ensure that you don't include invalid machine configuration in your test machine. Invalid machine configs include `invoke`, `after`, and any actions with a `delay`.

  Added `createTestMachine`, which provides a slimmed-down API for creating machines which removes these types from the config type signature.

- [#3036](https://github.com/statelyai/xstate/pull/3036) Thanks [@davidkpiano](https://github.com/davidkpiano)! - `getShortestPaths()` and `getPaths()` will now traverse all _transitions_ by default, not just all events.

  Take this machine:

  ```ts
  const machine = createTestMachine({
    initial: 'toggledOn',
    states: {
      toggledOn: {
        on: {
          TOGGLE: 'toggledOff'
        }
      },
      toggledOff: {
        on: {
          TOGGLE: 'toggledOn'
        }
      }
    }
  });
  ```

  In `@xstate/test` version 0.x, this would run this path by default:

  ```txt
  toggledOn -> TOGGLE -> toggledOff
  ```

  This is because it satisfies two conditions:

  1. Covers all states
  2. Covers all events

  But this a complete test - it doesn't test if going from `toggledOff` to `toggledOn` works.

  Now, we seek to cover all transitions by default. So the path would be:

  ```txt
  toggledOn -> TOGGLE -> toggledOff -> TOGGLE -> toggledOn
  ```

- [#3036](https://github.com/statelyai/xstate/pull/3036) Thanks [@mattpocock](https://github.com/mattpocock), [@davidkpiano](https://github.com/davidkpiano)! - Moved `events` from `createTestModel` to `path.test`.

  Old:

  ```ts
  const model = createTestModel(machine, {
    events: {}
  });
  ```

  New:

  ```ts
  const paths = model.getPaths().forEach((path) => {
    path.test({
      events: {}
    });
  });
  ```

  This allows for easier usage of per-test mocks and per-test context.

- [#3036](https://github.com/statelyai/xstate/pull/3036) Thanks [@mattpocock](https://github.com/mattpocock), [@davidkpiano](https://github.com/davidkpiano)! - Added `states` to `path.test()`:

  ```ts
  const paths = model.getPaths().forEach((path) => {
    path.test({
      states: {
        myState: () => {},
        'myState.deep': () => {}
      }
    });
  });
  ```

  This allows you to define your tests outside of your machine, keeping the machine itself easy to read.

### Minor Changes

- [#3036](https://github.com/statelyai/xstate/pull/3036) Thanks [@mattpocock](https://github.com/mattpocock), [@davidkpiano](https://github.com/davidkpiano)! - Added `path.testSync(...)` to allow for testing paths in sync-only environments, such as Cypress.
