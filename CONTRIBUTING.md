## Contributing to our docs

Our [new docs](https://stately.ai/docs) are now in their own [docs repo](https://github.com/statelyai/docs). [Read the contribution guide for our Stately Studio and XState docs](https://github.com/statelyai/docs/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

### Legacy docs and xstate.js.org

The docs at `/docs` in this repo are legacy XState docs. They are built using [Vuepress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org) and deployed to [xstate.js.org/docs](https://xstate.js.org/docs) using GitHub pages from the `gh-pages` branch using the `pages build and deployment` workflow.

The [xstate.js.org](https://xstate.js.org) landing page is currently stored at `index.html` and deployed from the `gh-pages` branch using the `pages build and deployment` workflow.

## Setup

### Building

We are using [preconstruct](https://preconstruct.tools/) to build our packages. It comes with a handy trick which allows us to always use source files of packages contained in this monorepo. It creates hook/redirecting files in place of dist files during development. This always happens after installing packages (during `postinstall` step) and you shouldn't be worried about it, but if you actually build packages you destroy those redirecting files and to run tests, typechecking etc correctly you need to bring them back by running `yarn postinstall`.

### Publishing

We are using [changesets](https://github.com/atlassian/changesets) to create "release intents" for our packages. When those pop up on master a release PR gets prepared automatically and once it gets merged actual release happen (also automatically).
