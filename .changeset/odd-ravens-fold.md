Fix TypeScript error localization in `createStore(â€¦)` overloads

Previously, TS errors in transitions would appear on the `createStore` call itself rather than on the specific transition. This was caused by the 3rd overload (for `StoreLogic`) interfering with overload resolution. The fix reorders the overloads and makes the `StoreLogic` overload more specific, ensuring errors are properly localized to the transition level.
