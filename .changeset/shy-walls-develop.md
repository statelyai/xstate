Support for compound string state values has been dropped from Machine's transition method. It's no longer allowed to call transition like this - `machine.transition('a.b', { type: 'NEXT' })`, instead it's required to use "state value" representation like this - `machine.transition({ a: 'b' }, { type: 'NEXT' })`.
